/*** Here we have some basic Javascript code and we need to highlight the difference between Javascript and Typescript *** 
 * 
 * 
 * For lesson one, we need to cover the primitive types, the object types, and the array types.
 * 
 * Primitive types are the most basic building blocks of the language. They are the smallest units of data that can be stored in a variable. 
 * 
 * Create a variable called myName and assign it a string value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called myAge and assign it a number value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called myHeight and assign it a null value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called myRegEx and assign it a regular expression value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called myArray and assign it an array of strings.
 * 
 * Create a variable called numberArray and assign it an array of numbers.
 * 
 * Create a variable called users and assign it an object with two string property types.
 * 
 * Create a variable called ids and assign it an object with two number property types.
 * 
 * Create a variable called today and assign it a Date value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called identificationRecord and assign it an object with the Record Type (a name and a string value).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Create a variable called myFunction and assign it a function value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called myBoolean and assign it a boolean value.
 * 
 * Create a variable called myUndefined and assign it an undefined value.
 * 
 * Turn your file into a function-based component.
